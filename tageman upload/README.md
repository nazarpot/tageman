# tageman
A video game using TAGE. A 3D and multiplayer rendition of PacMan.

I was thinking if win condition for TAGEMAN is to eat all the fruits (cherry, strawberry, orange, apple). While ghosts just try to prevent that


## Roadmap
### Things to Do:
1. Make Maze
2. Implement basic movement and camera control
3. Implement basic networking
4. Make skybox
5. Make terrain
6. Make models for TAGEMAN and Ghost
7. ------- MILESTONE 1 -------
8. Implement interactions between players
9. Implement HUD
10. Implement power berry functionality
11. Lighting
12. Ghost lighting
13. Background music and eating sound
14. TAGEMAN Animation
15. NPC
16. AI for NPC
17. ------- MILESTONE 2 -------

### Additional features to implement:
1. Fireflower model and functionality
2. Bowser Ghost model and functionality
3. Viewport functionality

## Brainstorming and overview of ideas
Models (obj):
1. TAGEMAN
2. Ghosts
3. Bowser Ghost (additional)
4. fire flower (additional)

skybox: TRON inspired sky with red grid lines
terrain: ???
lights: [idea: ghosts light up with blue if they are able to be eaten by TAGEMAN]
HUD: displays lives left . (not sure what the other HUD would display or if we would use it at all)
Background sound: somekind of pacman like music (can get from NCS)
3D Sound: when eating ghosts, eating power berry, when ghosts touch TAGEMAN, and fireballs
Animation: TAGEMAN eating
NPC: ???
Heirarchal SceneGraph: ???
Physics: collision detection between walls and other avatars

###### Additional Stuff
Viewport: ghosts can see a map and where each of them is on the map but not TAGEMAN. TAGEMAN gets to see everything.
